                        I am currently a <Bolden>software developer</Bolden> at File Dynamics Ltd. in <Bolden>Bristol, UK</Bolden>. The work is 
                        focused on building <Bolden>web</Bolden> and <b>WPF</b> applications,
                        centred around the legal sector. I have a <b>Master of Computing</b> degree with First Class Honours. It was awarded at <b>University of 
                        Central Lancashire</b> in 2017, for the course <b>Computer Games Development</b>. I aim to eventually save up and get a doctorate, because 
                        who doesn't want to be a doctor of computers!?

                        The purpose of this website is to give insight into myself, my interests, and some projects I have worked on. The site also seemed like a good
                        excuse to learn Blazor with .NET 6. Feel free to have a nosey around! If you have any questions, or suggestions on how to
                        improve the site, please don't hesitate to contact me.
