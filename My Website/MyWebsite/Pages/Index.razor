                        I am currently a software developer at File Dynamics Ltd, in Bristol, which is a position I have been in for about a year. The work is focused
                        on building web and WPF applications, centred around the legal sector. I have a Master of Computing degree with First Class Honours. It was awarded at
                        University of Central Lancashire in 2017, for the course Computer Games Development. I hope to one day get my doctorate, because who doesn't want to be
                        a doctor of computers?

                        The purpose of this website is to give insight into myself, my interests, and some projects I have worked on. The site also seemed like a good
                        excuse to learn Blazor with .NET 5. Feel free to have a nosey around! If you have any questions, or suggestions on how to
                        improve the site, please don't hesitate to contact me.

                        I have also added a section to my website recently, which aims to show educational visualisations to common algorithms. I hope you find it
                        as entertaining to use as I did making it! :)
