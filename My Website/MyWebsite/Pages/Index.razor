                    <MudText>
                        I am currently a <Bolden>full stack software developer</Bolden> at File Dynamics Ltd. in <Bolden>Bristol, UK</Bolden>. The work is 
                        focused on building <Bolden>web</Bolden> and <Bolden>WPF</Bolden> applications, centred around the legal sector. I have a 
                        <Bolden>Master of Computing</Bolden> degree with First Class Honours. It was awarded at <Bolden>University of Central Lancashire</Bolden> 
                        in 2017, for the course <Bolden>Computer Games Development</Bolden>. I aim to eventually save up and get a doctorate, because 
                        who doesn't want to be a doctor of computers!?

                        I created this site as a place where I can dump my <Bolden>interests</Bolden> and <Bolden>memories</Bolden>, develop and show off some <Bolden>small projects</Bolden>,
                        and hopefully help others (and myself) to <Bolden>learn</Bolden>! It's also become a good excuse to develop something using the <Bolden>Blazor WASM with .NET 6</Bolden>
                        (making modern websites for the non-technical folk)! I hope you enjoy your visit - please don't hesitate to <Bolden>contact me</Bolden> if notice issues with the site; 
                        want to suggest improvements; or just to say hi! There's a contact quick-link at the top right.
