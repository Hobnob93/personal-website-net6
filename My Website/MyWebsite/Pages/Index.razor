                        I am currently a <Bolden>software developer</Bolden> at File Dynamics Ltd. in <Bolden>Bristol, UK</Bolden>. The work is 
                        focused on building <Bolden>web</Bolden> and <Bolden>WPF</Bolden> applications,
                        centred around the legal sector. I have a <Bolden>Master of Computing</Bolden> degree with First Class Honours. It was awarded at <Bolden>University of 
                        Central Lancashire</Bolden> in 2017, for the course <Bolden>Computer Games Development</Bolden>. I aim to eventually save up and get a doctorate, because 
                        who doesn't want to be a doctor of computers!?

                        I created this site as a place where I can dump my interests and memories, develop and show off some small projects, and hopefully help others to learn!
                        It's also become a good excuse to develop something using the Blazor WASM with .NET 6 (making modern websites for the non-technical folk)! I hope you enjoy 
                        your visit - please don't hesitate to contact me if notice issues with the site; want to suggest improvements; or just to say hi! There's a contact 
                        quick-link at the top right.
